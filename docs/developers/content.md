# Content
 For a reference on using the content view to fill in content, please see the [user documentation on content](../users/cmi/content.md).

 For a developer, content composes the bedrock of a query. Every data field present on a content model is queryable.

 Take a project with this type of model:

 <!-- TODO: Add image of test content -->

 You can write queries like this:
<!-- TODO: Add image of test content -->

 this:
<!-- TODO: Add image of test content -->

 and even this:
<!-- TODO: Add image of test content -->

 And they are all valid.

 That's the power of GraphQL.

 We are also adding support for saved views. In a saved view, you could write a custom query or add custom labels to projects to group them together for ultimate content creator workflow.
