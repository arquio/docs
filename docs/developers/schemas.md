# Schemas
Schemas are the bedrock of your project. You can read more about GraphQL schemas proper [here.](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) In GraphCMS, the Schema tab of a project window allows you to define models and enumerations.

As a developer, you have full control over the shape of these schemas. You can define who can view the content from the CMI, who can query it from the API, what fields the model supports and what options an enum contains. For more information on which default user types have access to a model by default, see the information below.

Every field you add to a model and every option you add to an enumeration will be visible to a inflection query. For more about inflection, please see ["making a call"]('./api/making-a-call.md').

## Enumerations
