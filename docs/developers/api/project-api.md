# Project API
Under the hood there are two API's at work. The Project API and the System API. The project API allows CRUD operations on your content _within_ a project. After a project is created, a unique api is generated just for the context of that project.

See the [System API](./system-api.md) docs here.

## Project API Shape
The Project API Shape is impossible to define. Each API changes depending on defined schema [models](../schemas.md#models), [enumerations](../schemas.md#enumerations) and user roles.

Let's take an example of this project's Content Management Interface (CMI).

<!-- TODO: SCREENSHOT:CMI:WINDOW -->

The generated API would look something like this:

<!-- TODO: METHODS:PROJECT -->
