# Management API
Under the hood there are two API's at work. The Project API and the Management API. The Management API allows CRUD operations within the context of your _account._ You can create new projects, update models and define new schemas.

See the [Project API](./project-api.md) docs here.

## Management API Shape
The schema of the Management API is a known entity. From time to time we will release updates to the schema, but in contrast to the project API, the methods won't change much.
