GraphCMS offers an accurate and versatile facial detection feature. The below will illustrate how to use the function to detect faces and crop pictures automatically based on the face detection information.

The feature is divided into four endpoints, one for detection, one for cropping and two filters. We will discuss the detection first.

!!! Hint ""
    The maximum accepted image size is 100.000.000 pixels. An image with this many pixels could have width and height combinations like 10.000 x 10.000 or 5.000 x 20.000, etc. The maximum file size of an image can not be larger than 256mb.

> > This parameter is used to weed out objects that most likely are not faces. This can be an integer or a float in a range from 0.01 to 10000. The default value is 0.35. If the value set is larger than 1, it is used as the expected minimum size of face objects in pixels. So for example if the value is set to 200, then the smallest face object it will detect is 200x200 pixels. If the value that is set is less than 1, i.e. 0.3, then it filters out all face objects it detects that are smaller than the middle/average object size by 30%. This means that if a set of 3 objects are detected that are (size in pixels) ['100x100', '200x200', '300x300'], then setting minsize to 0.3 will result in a calculation where the middle object size 200 is used: 200-0.30*200=140 and all objects smaller than 140x140 would be eliminated.
