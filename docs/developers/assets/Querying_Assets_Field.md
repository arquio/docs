    The maximum accepted image size is 100.000.000 pixels. An image with this many pixels could have width and height combinations like 10.000 x 10.000 or 5.000 x 20.000, etc. The maximum file size of an image can not be larger than 256mb.

Uploaded asset files can be queried from your content API. LetÂ´s assume we have a content model `Post`, with a field configuration of:

* Title `#title` `Single Line Text`
* Images `#images` `Assets` `Allow Multiple Values`

This will allow us to store an arbitrary number of images for a `Post`.

We can fetch `allPosts` with the following query:

```
{
  allPosts {
    title
    images {
      fileName
      handle
      url
      mimeType
      size
    }
  }
}
```

Which will give us a result like this:

```
{
  "data": {
    "allPosts": [
      {
        "title": "Some nice post",
        "images": [
          {
            "fileName": "pexels-photo-295821.jpeg",
            "handle": "7AmzJToStuJrNqkpPSWO"
            "url": "https://media.graphcms.com/7AmzJToStuJrNqkpPSWO",
            "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
            "size": 100075,
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Field `#images` will return an array of asset objects, which contain the fields:

* `fileName` the original file name of the uploaded file
* `handle` the identifier of the uploaded file
* `url` the full URL to the uploaded file
* `mimeType` the asset type of the uploaded file
* `size` the total size in bytes
