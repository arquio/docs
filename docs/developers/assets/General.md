Working with assets is an essential part of content management. GraphCMS allows you to upload and assign asset files to any content model in your project. The uploaded files will be assigned to the projectÂ´s internal `Asset` model. `Asset fields` will then connect the dots between a content model and assigned files.

Asset files that are stored in GraphCMS are served via a global content delivery network. This assures quick response times and fast loading of your assets.
