# Models
Models will makeup 90% or more of your project. When you create a structure such as `Author`, `Book`, `Publisher` and `Book Club`, these are nearly exclusively Models. Any time the content contains multiple values, you can be sure you want a model.

This is a contrast to [Enumerations](enumerations.md) which are a finite list of options that are themselves just one value. This could represent `In Print, Out of Print` options on your `Book` model, for example.

## Creating a Model
Creating a model is very easy! Click on the blue button "Create Model" and you'll be presented with a screen like this.

!["Model window in the CMI."](../../gitbook/images/screenshots/createModelArtist.png)

### Display Name
This helps you identify the Model in your interface.
### API ID
This is generated for you automatically, but you can rename it if you want. Generally you will just leave this as we suggest.
### Description
A small description for you to remember the intended use of this model.

## Fields
Out of the box, we offer a complete set of field types for you to work with. We will look at them in depth here.

You can view the fields by clicking on the tab to the right of the editor window.

!["Show Fields"](../../gitbook/images/app/show-fields.gif)

### Supported Fields
All fields support the same basic parameters as creating a model. **Display Name**, **API ID**, and **Description**.

Additionally, with the exception of **Relations** and **Enumerations**, they also support **Is List?** which allows you to add multiple values to the field.

### Editing Fields
At the moment you can't edit a field. You can delete it and create a new one. This helps preserve the integrity of the data and any other projects that might be relying on it. If you really need to edit a field, you can do so with the Management API.

### Deleting Fields
You can delete a field by hover over the entry in your model. A red trash can will appear, click on that and then confirm by clicking the second prompt.

### Types of Fields

#### Single line text
!["Single line text"](../../gitbook/images/app/single-line-text.png)

Single line text can be considered like a proper noun. A super hero is a type of person, that's a model in general. A Super Hero's name is unique and won't be typically shared with another Super Hero. A unique string is a good option here.

Alternatively, you could use the **Is List?** option to include a range of aliases that the Super Hero goes by.

#### Multi line text
!["Multi line text"](../../gitbook/images/app/multi-line-text.png)

Because of how databases work, its helpful to distinguish between small text fields and big text fields. Generally speaking, smaller text fields are more efficient. However they're not idea for, well, long text. Use these to describe your Super Hero's bio.

#### Markdown
!["Markdown"](../../gitbook/images/app/markdown.png)

For really long text, or just for when you are feeling fancy, markdown is the lingua franca on the web for content editors these days. So, of course, we've got you covered. This could be used to regale readers with your Super Hero's long backstory.

#### Integer
!["Integer"](../../gitbook/images/app/integer.png)

Integers are for round numbers. Consider this for an age field.

#### Float
!["Float"](../../gitbook/images/app/float.png)

Again, for efficiency sake, numbers have been split into different types for technical reasons. Floats are numbers which can have decimals in them. This would be good for fine tune numbers like Super Hero strength.

#### Checkbox
!["Checkbox"](../../gitbook/images/app/checkbox.png)

For those yes/no options, checkboxes are the go-to solution. Is the Super Hero retired?

#### Date
!["Date"](../../gitbook/images/app/date.png)

Quite simple, this could be a Super Hero birth date or the start of their Super Heroism. You decide.

#### DateTime
!["DateTime"](../../gitbook/images/app/date-time.png)

*Again*, another example of identical data types all for technical reasons! We get it can be annoying, but choosing the most simple form your data can take will make your app run faster. Date and Time fields, for when the seconds matter.

#### Json
!["Json"](../../gitbook/images/app/json.png)

*Warning, nerd alert!* JSON is meant for people who understand what JSON is. It's a type of data object that can store as much data as you want. Sometimes you will be bringing over data from another system, and you simply don't have time to recreate all the data with out beautiful fields. If you can get your old data in JSON format, just stick it in here and call it a day.

Adventurous users will imagine what kinds of possibilities could be had by using the JSON field and our webhooks!

#### Asset
!["Asset"](../../gitbook/images/app/asset.png)

Assets are images. Assets need to be created before they can be attached to content you create, but in creating a model, you need to define a field to support them! [See the Asset docs](./assets.md) for more information.

#### Enumeration
!["Enumeration"](../../gitbook/images/app/enumeration.png)

Enumerations are similar to drop-down selections. You first need to [create an enumeration](./enumerations.md) before you can add one to your model. These fields, called enums for short, are a predefined list of singular values. Let's imagine this is as a mood selection for our Super Hero. His mood could be one of Very Happy, Happy, Sad, Very Sad. Even Super Heroes are sad sometimes!

#### Relation
!["Relation"](../../gitbook/images/app/connect.png)

Relations, called the _Connect_ field, are one of the most powerful fields available. As such, they deserve their own page of documentation. In short, they are allow you to connect two models together. Their options are more complex than just that, so to read more about them, view the [Relations Doc](./relations.md).

This is how you would associate a Super Hero with an Allegiance, Secret Hideout, Super Power or other types of models you might create.

<!-- ## Inspecting the Model -->

## Editing the Model
At the moment, editing the model is limited to deleting fields and adding new ones. Developers have more power via the Management API.

## Deleting the Model
You can delete the Model by hovering over the title of the model, a red trashcan will appear. Type in the name of the Model when prompted to delete.
