# Assets
The asset window is a first class model that supports special methods and utilities for developers. For users, images are also commonly handled differently with their own unique workflow such as gathering permissions, managing edits and optimizing variations for different platforms.

## The Wiindow
At it's most basic, the assets window looks like this:
![CMI window for assets.](../../gitbook/images/app/assets-page.png)

From here, you can upload a file from various service providers. They are:
* My Device (Your current device)
* Link (URL)
* Web Search
* Facebook
* Instagram
* Google Drive
* Dropbox

![CMI window for assets.](../../gitbook/images/app/asset-upload-page.png)

These assets will be avialable both in other models and to query on their own for ultimate gallery action.
